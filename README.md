# diff-eq-solver

This program uses various finite difference methods to solve ordinary differential equations and partial differential 
equations. For partial differential equations, we focus on special types of partial differential equations, such as the 
heat equation, wave equation, and Laplace's equation. The solution values are organized in a table and written to an 
excel file and the solution is visually represented on a plot generated with Matplotlib.

1. numpy
2. matplotlib
